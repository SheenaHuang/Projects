# Projects


#### Big Data Solution | PySpark, Hive, GCP
`PUBG Conprehensive Analysis`
    
  - Used PySpark SQL on Google Cloud Cluster to explore winning-strategies for players and potential feature improvements by analyzing 19 Gigabytes of game statistics for 720K+ matches using PySpark SQL on Google Cloud Cluster
     
  - Achieved R2 equaling 92% (50% over baseline model) by training regression models using PySpark to predict final placement with more features
    
  - Identified most connected players and potential friends through network graph analysis using Spark Graphframe to make recommendations to improve player experience
   
  - Presented all visualized exploratory data analysis (EDA) findings and heatmaps of popular landing positions and most possible final safe zone positions
   
   
#### Machine Learning | Python, TensorFlow
`Skin Cancer Detection`

  - Fine-tuned traditional classification models to detect skin cancer at 82% recall score by learning from a data set of 1400 benign mole and 1200 malignant mole images
  
  - Constructed a 9-layer Convolutional Neural Network and modified VGG 16 using TensorFlow to compare with other models having the recall score to 87%

  - Enhanced the neural network learning by augmenting 2600 images data by rotation, flip and brightness changes to double the data size, and speeded up neural network models by data pre-processing

#### Data Mining | Python
`Wine Quality Prediction`

  - Built and trained machine learning classification models, such as SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, using Scikit learn library to predict the wine quality on physicochemical red wine data 

  - Generated new data points for minority groups to solve imbalanced dataset problem using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique Estimation (SMOTE) to increase accuracy from 64% to 84% on the training dataset

#### NLP | Python
`News Articles NLP Analysis`

  - Built pipeline to clean, filter and classify 50K web crawled Illinois news articles using RegEx, NLTK tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization to find out main reasons for Illinois population decline   

  - Customized sentiment analysis to increase subjectivity of sentiment score by utilizing Textblob sentiment analysis and logistic regression for most mentioned influencing entities of person and organization
 
  - Drew actionable recommendations by generating word clouds of positive sentiment articles 


#### Data Engineer | OpenRefine, MySQL, Tableau
`Yelp Restuarants Analysis`
  - Wrote SQL queries to analyze restaurant data from Yelp and city data from DATA USA to advise on market strategy and market saturation and trending
  
  - Facilitated future analysis by establishing the database and Enhanced Entity Relation(EER) model of 7 third-degree normalized tables using MySQL to store preprocessed data
  
  - Created a Tableau dashboard to visualize all SQL query results
